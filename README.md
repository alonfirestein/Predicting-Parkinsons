# Predicting Parkinson's Disease Using ML

Using the available online dataset of Parkinson's Disease and it's patients, I used different machine learning algorithims and models to try and predict if a patient is confirmed with the disease or not depending on the data of each patient in the dataset.

### Model Accuaracy:
|Model Name:  | Accuracy %: |
|-------------|-------------|
|KNN          | 87.18%      |
|Random Forest|89.74%       |
|XGBoost      | 94.87%      |
|MinMaxScaler | 97.96%      |
